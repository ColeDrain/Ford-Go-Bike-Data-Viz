## Summary of Findings

Some of my findings during the exploration phase include:

Males are the most bike sharers, and it was interesting to note that other genders apart from male and female were captured as others.

Bike-sharers are mainly Subscribed users with a very large percentage.

A large majority don't bike-share all through the trip, they could be doing something else.

Thursdays are very popular for taking bike-sharing trips, and also fewer trips are taken during weekends.

5pm seems to be a very popular hour for bike-sharing

Powell St. BART Station (Market st at 4th St) is the most common station for bike-share

Most bike-sharers fall in the 30-40 years age bracket, surprisingly there was a 141 years old user who bike-shared.

I plan to bring a few of them that are interesting to my explanatory presentation

## Key Insights for Presentation

The patterns in the various gender type and user types in the bike sharing business and also trip duration patterns
I have chosen these insights because they model real world problems and could help in the bike-sharing decision making, particularly on the user type.
